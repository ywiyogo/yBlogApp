After learning about web application for 4 months. Now I can deploy my flask-markdown-powered personal website.
This website is built using python framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/). [James Harding's work](http://www.jamesharding.ca) has inspired me to create this website.

For the first time, I'm going to launch it with Raspberry Pi 2 at home. The front-end is based on material design and inspired from [deviserweb ](http:http://deviserweb.com/).
The exciting thing is that I do not install any database system for it. I write this article using a normal text editor with markdown syntax.
