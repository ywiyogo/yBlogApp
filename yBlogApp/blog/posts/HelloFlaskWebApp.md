After learning about the web application technology at Udacity for about 4 months, and reading several tutorials. Now, I can deploy my flask-markdown-powered personal website.
This website is built using python framework [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/). The supporting web server is Nginx. Moreover, [James Harding's work](http://www.jamesharding.ca) has inspired me to create this website.

For the first time, I'm going to launch it with Raspberry Pi 2 at home. The front-end is based on material design and inspired from [deviserweb](http:http://deviserweb.com/).
The exciting thing is that I do not install any database system for it. I write this article using a normal text editor with markdown syntax.

Next coming features are:

* multi languages web application, since I'm going to write in Indonesian also.
* Backend functionality for the contact form
* integrating disqus for comments
* integrating charts and graphs
* full text search
